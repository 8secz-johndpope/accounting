Hello,

At the beginning of each month, to help you gain time in invoicing your hours, I automatically build an invoice based on the worklogs you logged in Jira the month before.

I just wanted to let you know that I'll be doing this soon -- I'll send you an invoice for {{ month }} to approve on {{ approval_date|date:"F jS" }}.

Stay tuned!
